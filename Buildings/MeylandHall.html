<h2>Meyland Hall</h2>

<p>Upon entering Meyland, guests and residents are welcomed by Hall and House banners, which are one of the many Hall traditions. Hall dinners, cookouts, and activities in the courtyard are other popular events which bring the residents closer.</p>

<p>Meyland is certainly a unique place to live. It is made up of only four Houses instead of six, which creates opportunities for closer interaction and a sense of family. Meyland also houses USOEC resident athletes and visitors from around the world on third floor. Being a very competitive hall, Meylanders enjoy competitions between the Houses, other Halls, and are active participants in intramurals. Recently renovated in 2006, Meyland is a L.E.E.D. certified, coed building and the residents are encouraged to live a green lifestyle.</p>
