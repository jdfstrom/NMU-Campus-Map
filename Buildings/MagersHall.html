<h2>Magers Hall</h2>

<p>Magers Hall isn’t just a place to live; it is a place where responsible leaders are shaped.  Magers Hall provides students with a relaxed atmosphere that promotes individuality and “small group” identity.  Students have a great balance between academics, social events, and community involvement. Magers Hall was completely renovated during the summer of 2005 and students were given the opportunity to create a theme and house names for the building. Students agree that Magers Hall is friendly, comfortable, generally quiet, and “homey”.  Magers Hall consists of six co-ed houses. </p>
