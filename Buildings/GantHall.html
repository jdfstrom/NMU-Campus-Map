<h2>Gant Hall</h2>

<p>In Gant Hall students are accepted for who they are individually. Students are encouraged to be involved within their community and build lasting relationships by trying new hobbies, developing new lifestyles, and learning about their peersâ€™ backgrounds. Gant residents identify their communities as involved, spontaneous, and close-knit. Living in the Gant Hall community provides students with an active yet relaxed college experience that is represented with long lasting friendships and pride. Gant Hall is made up of five co-ed houses and one all male house.</p>
