<p>A major renovation in 2004 completely changed the original 1956 fieldhouse building, at first officially named the C.B. Hedgcock Health and Physical Education Building, which housed gymnasiums, a natatorium, locker and shower rooms, and other facilities and offices. The 5,000-seat fieldhouse hosted many commencement ceremonies, concerts, speakers and events. It was named after Charles B. Hedgcock (1887 – 1986), who was head of Northern’s School of Health and Human Performance from 1922 to 1956 and served as football, basketball and track coach.</p>
