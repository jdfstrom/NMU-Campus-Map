<h2>Halverson Hall</h2>

<p>This is primarily a classroom building, containing five large lecture halls, holding up to 500 students, and numerous smaller classrooms. In addition to its academic uses, films shown by student groups, community lectures and events, student plays and faculty recitals are also held here. The basement houses some faculty offices. Jamrich is connected to the Seaborg Center with a skywalk.
The building is named after former NMU President John X. Jamrich (1968-1983).</p>
