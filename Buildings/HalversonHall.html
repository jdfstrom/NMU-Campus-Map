<h2>Halverson Hall</h2>

<p>When walking through Halverson you will experience a high energy, open door community with strong hall identity.  Supporting an open door policy promotes healthy social networking and positive student growth. This encouraging environment helps students create a balance between their social and academic lives.  Halverson is a strong supporter for Women for Women with its two all female houses. The hall is also made up of one all male house and three co-ed houses. Halverson’s reputation makes it more than just a place to live, it’s a family.</p>
