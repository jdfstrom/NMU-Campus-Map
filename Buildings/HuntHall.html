<h2>Hunt Hall</h2>

<p>Hunt Hall is built on traditions, open mindedness, and friendliness. Hunt Hall is also a LEED certified complex and was completely renovated during the summer of 2008.  The students of Hunt create a fun and open environment for all and welcome new ideas and faces to the community.  Some of Hunt Hall’s well known traditions include annual camp outs, hiking trips, the Hunt Hall Talent Show, and the “Arctic Plunge”.  Great, lasting memories and good friends are a result of living in Hunt Hall.</p>
