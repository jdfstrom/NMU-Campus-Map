<h2>Jacobetti Center</h2>

<p>The complex is located north of NMU’s main campus and spans nearly five acres. It is home to the Center for Innovation and Industrial Technologies, which is composed of three existing departments: technology and occupational sciences, engineering technology, and continuing education and workforce development. The facility also houses Northern Initiatives, a community development financial institution; the NMU Regional Police Academy; a branch of the Academic Career and Advisement Center; UP North Films, specializing in documentaries; and Head Start preschool.</p>

<p>The Jacobetti Complex features more than 40 specialized laboratories and classrooms. Students learn skills in the mechanical and electrical engineering, aviation maintenance, hospitality management, cosmetology, automotive repair, construction management, building technology, electronics, industrial technology and skilled trades such as HVAC, welding, industrial maintenance and computer numerical control (CNC).</p>

<p>A large lobby area, known as “the commons,” provides tables and seating for studying, discussions or enjoying food from the student-run Culinary Café. The upscale Chez Nous restaurant nearby serves as a training ground for cooking and hospitality services.</p>

<p>The complex is named for longtime Upper Peninsula Representative Dominic J. Jacobetti.</p>
