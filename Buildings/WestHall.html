<h2>West Hall</h2>

<p>West Hall is best described by a previous resident as, “…a good experience. It is like one big happy family here. Since we all live close to each other, everyone pretty much knows their neighbor and looks out for one another”. West Hall is up-campus, located adjacent to the University Center, and residents commonly eat at the Wildcat Den. Residents in West come from varied backgrounds, but come together to form a close-knit community. West holds an annual formal for its residents, deciding a new theme each year, as a long standing tradition. West is a great place to live, because it offers convenient access to different buildings on campus and feels like home away from home.</p>
