<h2>Spooner Hall</h2>

<p>Spooner Hall is centrally located near most of NMU's facilities. Spooner is a relatively small residence hall that is unique because it specifically houses upperclassmen (junior status or higher), and students twenty-one years of age or older. Some long standing traditions in Spooner are the Meat-a-Palooza and Halloween Party.  As an interesting fact, current Michigan State University men's basketball coach Tom Izzo and former NFL football coach Steve Mariucci were roommates in Spooner Hall.  Spooner Hall features single rooms and double apartments with kitchenettes.</p>
